			.panel-body
				| GlusterFS is a scalable network filesystem. Using common off-the-shelf hardware, you can create large, distributed storage solutions for media streaming, data analysis, and other data- and bandwidth-intensive tasks. GlusterFS is free and open source software.

				h3.panel-title Not using GlusterFS?
			.panel-body
				| By default Atomia is set up with GlusterFS, however it works fine with just about any other storage system as long as the following requirements are fulfilled:
				ul
					li Can connect to Active Directory
					li Perform idmappings (rfc2307)
					li Can export nfs and cifs (if hosting IIS websites)
				| To proceed with your already existing storage system click the skip button below, otherwise read on...
				p
					button.btn.btn-lg.btn-success(type="submit",onClick="window.location.href = '/wizard/next_step/2';") Skip GlusterFS

			.panel-body
				| This installation process will take care of the complete installation of GlusterFS on as many nodes as you like. Before you start, make sure you have the following:
				ul
					li 2 or more base installed Ubuntu 14.04 servers
					li A physical volume available on each server (path configurable but should be the same on all servers)
					li (optional) 2 network cards (make sure DNS points to the network to use for storage traffic or enter the IP address on the storage net below)
